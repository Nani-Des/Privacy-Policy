Privacy Policy for Nhap
Last Updated: April 25, 2025
Nhap is a mobile health application developed by MESTI, designed to provide offline first-aid guidance, local language support (e.g., Twi, Ewe), nearby doctor search, appointment scheduling, and a public health forum for users in Ghana. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your data when you use Nhap.
By using Nhap, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.
1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information to provide and improve Nhap’s services:

a. Personal Information

User Profile: When you create an account, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and preferred language (e.g., Twi, Ewe) to personalize your experience and facilitate appointment scheduling.
Appointment Data: When you schedule appointments with healthcare providers, we collect details such as appointment date, time, and provider information.
Forum Posts: If you participate in the public health forum, we collect your posts and comments, which may include personal health information you choose to share.

b. Device and Usage Information

Location Data: With your permission, we collect precise location data (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) to help you find nearby doctors and healthcare facilities. Location data is collected only when you want to improve app  user experience or find a nearby hospital and is not stored or shared.
Camera and Audio: With your permission, we access your camera (CAMERA) for video consultations and your microphone (RECORD_AUDIO) for local language processing (e.g., voice input in Twi or Ewe). Camera and audio data are processed in real-time and not stored.
Crash Reports: We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymized crash reports to identify and fix app issues.

c. Offline Data

First-Aid Content: Offline first-aid guidance is stored locally on your device using Hive, in your chosen language (e.g., Twi, Ewe). This data is not transmitted to our servers unless you choose to share feedback.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve Nhap’s services, including:

Personalized Services: To display first-aid content in your preferred language and manage your user profile.
Doctor Search: To locate nearby healthcare providers based on your location (with your consent).
Appointments: To facilitate scheduling and communication with healthcare providers.
Public Health Forum: To enable discussions and share health-related information you post.
App Improvement: To analyze usage patterns (via Firebase Analytics) and fix crashes (via Firebase Crashlytics).
Local Language Support: To process voice inputs for local language interactions (e.g., Twi, Ewe) using on-device TensorFlow Lite models.

3. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except in the following cases:

Healthcare Providers: When you schedule an appointment, we share necessary details (e.g., your name, appointment time) with the provider to facilitate the service.
Service Providers: We use third-party services (e.g., Firebase for authentication, analytics, and Firestore) that process data on our behalf. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect the safety of Nhap users or the public.
Aggregated Data: We may share anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., usage statistics) with partners to improve public health initiatives in Ghana.

4. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including:

Encryption: Location data, appointment details, and user profiles are encrypted in transit and at rest (via Firebase).
On-Device Processing: Camera,  and audio data are processed locally and not stored or transmitted.
Access Controls: Only authorized personnel have access to personal data, and we use secure authentication methods.
Regular Audits: We conduct security reviews to ensure compliance with best practices.

Despite these measures, no system is completely secure. If you suspect a security breach, please contact us at support@mestihealth.com.
